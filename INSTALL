XName INSTALL for v2.3.0

WARNING: use these instruction for XName fresh installation only.
See MIGRATE file for migration from an older version of XName.

XName Database 
===================

First, go into the XName directory.

- edit sql/creation.sql
	change database name xnamedev for xname - or whatever name you want -
	in the two first lines
- run sql code
	$ mysql -upoweruser -p < sql/creation.sql


Database is now installed.


XName Language support
======================

Choose languages you want. Available are fr, pl, en.
If you want to suppress some, delete following directories where
[CC] is the two letters language code:

        html/includes/strings/[CC]
        bin/strings/[CC]



XName web interface
===================

- copy html/libs/config.default to html/libs/config.php and edit to suit
  your needs
- edit localized files
        index and disclaimer contents are now localized, and available in
                html/includes/strings/[CC]/index_content_default.php
                html/includes/strings/[CC]/warranty.php
        Copy index_content_default.php into index_content.php and 
	modify index_content.php and warranty.php to fit your needs.


Be careful, programs dig, host and named-checkzone have to be available from
your web server. Paths are configurable in the html/libs/config.php file.

If you want to use your own design instead of XName.org's one,
simply change each html/*.php file, accordingly 
with html/libs/html.php where original functions where present.
html/libs/html.php class & functions are used only in html/*.php files.

If you want to change left and right column organization or content,
copy html/includes/left_side_default.php to html/includes/left_side.php and
modify this new file. Do the same for the right_side.


XName DNS file generator & log insert
======================================

First, you have to install bind. Tested on v9.2.*

- edit your named.conf file (should be /etc/named.conf), configure general 
options, suppress eventually everything at the end concerning local zones. 
Be sure you've got a correctly running bind.

You have now a clean conf file. 
In bin/config.pl, you will define "$NAMED_CONF_ZONES" (in next step).
Put an include line at the end of your named.conf file, including this
file ($NAMED_CONF_ZONES="/etc/bind/xname-zones.conf" in our sample):
include "/etc/bind/xname-zones.conf";

This $NAMED_CONF_ZONES file will be generated automatically with
the scripts - simply do a "touch" on it to avoid errors before first
scripts run.
Then just copy whole named.conf into /etc/bind/named.conf or somewhere else
(to be configured at next step in bin/config.pl as $NAMED_CONF).

- copy bin/config.default to bin/config.pl
- edit bin/config.pl, and modify all vars to fit your needs.
Be sure named-checkconf is available on your system.

If you don't use a scheduler - ie in bin/config.pl you don't have
$SCHEDULER_RUN_AS_DAEMON=1; 
modify crontab.

WARNING: use of scheduler is HIGHLY recommended to prevent tasks 
overlapping in case of high number of hosted zones. 

Add in crontab a line for insertlogs.pl, every 10 mn
Add a crontab line for delete.pl and generate.pl every hour 
Add a crontab line for sqloptimize.pl, every week

/etc/crontab sample:
# XNAME
*/10 *    * * *   root    /home/xname/bin/insertlogs.pl
30   *    * * *   root    /home/xname/bin/delete.pl && /home/xname/bin/generate.pl
7    3    * * 1   root    /home/xname/bin/sqloptimize.pl

Add also a line for pushtoserver.pl script if you run multiserver
without rsync (see MULTISERVERS file)
If you use rsync, add your rsync command on the same line than delete.pl and
generate.pl (using && as separator, to execute right command only if left one
succeeded)
Else, if you run the scheduler, just run as root bin/scheduler.pl.
See doc/scheduler.txt for details.

Database initialization
=======================

run bin/install.pl and answer questions.
Run it once per server you want to add.

I - command generation

commands for a server - add, modify or delete zone - are
written in a command file.
command files are named  serverIP-timestamp.
All command files are in the same directory.


II - command push to remote servers

Command directory is parsed, all files serverIP-timestamp with
same serverIP are concatenated in the most recent one.
Then, the resulting command file for given server is pushed using scp
onto remote server, in specified directory (depending on server params
in xname-engine database)
command file is deleted on master server.


III - remote server command action

incoming command directory is parsed, if more than one file for
our IP is present, all is concatenated in one.
Then, resulting file is parsed, and modification are done - directly
on named.conf file or in DB if DB is used.


IV - remote server logs parsing 

logs are parsed on remote server, cleaned and written in a file.
If file exists, concatenation is done.


V - master server remote logs import

remote logs are retrieved from remote servers using scp, from
remote command directory as logpush.txt.
file is copied in a local directory specificly for remote logs import.
files are parsed, and logs inserted into DB.
files are locally purged, and copied remotely to purge them on remote server.

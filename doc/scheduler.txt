                     XName Scheduler
				

XName backend can be run in two ways: with it's own scheduler,
or using crontab. The scheduler will warranty that however long
will take a scheduled process to run, there will be no overlap
between it and other XName ones, nor between it and an other
running instance of itself.

In case of huge number of zones hosted, the scheduler use
is heavily advised.

To launch it:
1) modify $SCHEDULER_RUN_AS_DAEMON in bin/config.pl
2) launch it as root (because some scripts need root rights)
	./bin/scheduler.pl &

XName can now be run on different servers.

First, be sure to have a running XName installation with 
one server.


There are two ways. One using rsync, where secondaries
are a whole replication of the primary - see doc/rsync.txt
And one where only modifications are send to remote
servers.
Logical scheme is explained in doc/multiserver.txt.

For each new server, run bin/install.pl script.

How to run multiserver ?

If you choose rsync, follow doc/rsync.txt ! 

If you choose the second way, do as following:

- on the master server, add a crontab line for pushtoserver.pl, 
  every hour after generate.pl (on the same line, using && as separator)
 
- on the new server, do as for initial installation regarding named.conf.
- on the new server, install xname-module/bin content
- on the new server, edit and configure bin/config.pl
- on the new server, run periodically cleanlogs.pl and importfromserver.pl

Use of MySQL database on remote server is not already tested.
use at your own risks.

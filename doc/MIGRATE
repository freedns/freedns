To migrate from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.0
======================================
- Backup all your files
- Backup your SQL data in a file with mysqldump 
- Replace old files with new ones
- add missing vars from bin/config.default into
  bin/config.pl (all $DB_AUTH_* vars)
- add missing vars from html/libs/config.default
  into html/libs/config.php (all $this->userdb* vars)
- run script bin/migrate-2.2.x-to-2.3.0.pl

To migrate from version 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
=======================================
- Replace old files with new ones
- replace bin/config.pl with bin/config.default
  keeping a copy of the old file is suggested, for
  a faster configuration
- edit bin/config.pl, modify vars to fit your needs
- run script bin/migrate-2.1.x-to-2.2.0.pl
- modify your named.conf:
  xname-engine don't use anymore an header file to generate
  the master named.conf file, but it generates a dedicated file
  that needs to be included in your main named.conf file.
  So have a clean working named.conf file, and add similar line 
  to the end of it (this filename is as $NAMED_CONF_ZONES 
  in bin/config.pl):
include "xname-zones.conf";
  then just put this working named.conf file into 
  /etc/bind/named.conf or somewhere else
  (to be configured in bin/config.pl as $NAMED_CONF).


Choose languages you want. Available are fr, pl, en.
If you want to suppress some, delete following directories where
[CC] is the two letters language code:

	html/includes/strings/[CC] 
	bin/strings/[CC]


re-modify web interface:

- replace html/libs/config.php with html/libs/config.default
  keeping a copy of the old file is suggested, for
  a faster configuration
- edit html/libs/config.php
        change all items accordingly with your site configuration
- edit localized files
	index and disclaimer contents are now localized, and available in 
		html/includes/strings/[CC]/index_content.php
		html/includes/strings/[CC]/warranty.php
	modify them to fit your needs.
	
Be careful, programs dig, host and named-checkzone have to be available from
your web server. Paths are configurable in the html/libs/config.php file.

If you want to use your own design instead of XName.org's one,
simply change each html/*.php file, accordingly 
with html/libs/html.php where original functions where present.
html/libs/html.php class & functions are used only in html/*.php files.

If you want to change left and right column organization or content,
copy html/includes/left_side_default.php to html/includes/left_side.php and
modify this new file. Do the same for the right_side.
